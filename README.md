# Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)

This repository contains an implementation of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The VRP is a combinatorial optimization problem where the objective is to find the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver to a given set of customers, such that the total distance traveled is minimized.

## Features
- **Genetic Algorithm**: An evolutionary approach to solve the VRP.
- **Fitness Function**: Calculates the total distance of routes.
- **Selection, Crossover, Mutation**: Implements genetic operators to evolve the population.
- **Visualization**: Plots the best routes obtained after the optimization process.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vehicle-routing-problem.git
Navigate to the project directory:
